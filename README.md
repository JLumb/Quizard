### JShint Also returned with 0 errors for my JavaScript code.

# Further Testing

#### I sent friends and family the link of the website so they could  trial and test the website for any bugs or errors, I requested feedback from them.<br>This lead to me finding responsive design bugs where the quiz container didn't correctly display all the elements on different screen sizes,<br>after this feedback I created two media queries to adjust the size of the container for different screen sizes.

#### After the media queries were put in place the quiz displayed nicely on all screen sizes, I made the container height larger<br> The button grid would now display in rows of 1 instead of 2 on smaller screens too tidy up the presentation of the quiz.
